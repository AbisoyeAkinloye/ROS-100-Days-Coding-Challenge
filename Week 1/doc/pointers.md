# Pointers and Reference
## Pointers

A pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of another variable or object, called the *pointee*. Each object in memory has its type and an address.

*Syntax:*
```c++
int* ptr {};
```

**Note:** 
1. Integer pointer stores integer variable address. Same as other types.
2. To declare a pointer that points to a char (object) we declare a pointer of type char*.
3. You can explicitly initialize a null pointer. 
   
```c++
int* ptr {nullptr};
```
4. A pointer has the same size as the variable (8 bytes) in the memory.
5. Augumented variable declaration for pointer and an integer type.
 ```c++
 int *ptr {}, var_int {};
``` 
6. Assign address to a pointer. `&` - address operator.
7. Writing to an uninitialize or null pointer through dereferencing is a bad practice.

### Dereferencing of Pointer
To access a value stored in an object pointed to by a pointer, we need to dereference a pointer. Dereferencing is done by prepending a pointer (variable) name with a dereferencing `*` operator.

### Pointer to Character
Pointer to character can be initialized with a string literal: `C-string`.
```c++
const char* message {"Hello World"};
```

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
Dynamic memory allocation is allocating the memory you need to store the data youâ€™re working with at runtime, rather than having the amount of memory predefined when the program is compiled.

### Stack Vs Heap
An automatic variable is created when its definition is executed. The space for an automatic variable is allocated in a memory area called the **Stack**. Local variables are stored in the memory section called Stack.

Memory that is not occupied by the operating system or other programs that are currently loaded is called the **Heap**. You can request that space be allocated within the free store at runtime for a new variable of any type.
Use `new` keyword to use heap and `delete` to delete variable in heap memory.

| Stack     | Heap      |
|:---------:|:---------:|
|Memory is finite|Memory is finite|
|Dev not in full controll of memory lifestyle| Dev in full control of memory lifestyle|
|Lifetime is controlled by scope mechanism| Life style is controlled explicitly through `new` and `delete` operators|

```c++
// Memory location contains junk value
int* ptr {new int};

// Use direct initialization
int* ptr {new int(2022)};

// Use uniform initialization
int* ptr {new int{2022}};
```

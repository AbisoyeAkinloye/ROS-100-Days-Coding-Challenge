# Pointers and Reference
## Pointers

A pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of another variable or object, called the *pointee*. Each object in memory has its type and an address.

*Syntax:*
```c++
int* ptr {};
```

**Note:** 
1. Integer pointer stores integer variable address. Same as other types.
2. To declare a pointer that points to a char (object) we declare a pointer of type char*.
3. You can explicitly initialize a null pointer. 
   
```c++
int* ptr {nullptr};
```
4. A pointer has the same size as the variable (8 bytes) in the memory.
5. Augumented variable declaration for pointer and an integer type.
 ```c++
 int *ptr {}, var_int {};
``` 
6. Assign address to a pointer. `&` - address operator.
7. Writing to an uninitialize or null pointer through dereferencing is a bad practice.
8. `const` pointer variable not pointer-to-const.
```c++
    int* const ptr {};

    // not
    const int* ptr {}; 
```

### Dereferencing of Pointer
To access a value stored in an object pointed to by a pointer, we need to dereference a pointer. Dereferencing is done by prepending a pointer (variable) name with a dereferencing `*` operator.

### Pointer to Character
Pointer to character can be initialized with a string literal: `C-string`.
```c++
const char* message {"Hello World"};
```

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
Dynamic memory allocation is allocating the memory you need to store the data youâ€™re working with at runtime, rather than having the amount of memory predefined when the program is compiled.

### Stack Vs Heap
An automatic variable is created when its definition is executed. The space for an automatic variable is allocated in a memory area called the **Stack**. Local variables are stored in the memory section called Stack.

Memory that is not occupied by the operating system or other programs that are currently loaded is called the **Heap**. You can request that space be allocated within the free store at runtime for a new variable of any type.
Use `new` keyword to use heap and `delete` to delete variable in heap memory.

| Stack     | Heap      |
|:---------:|:---------:|
|Memory is finite|Memory is finite|
|Dev not in full controll of memory lifestyle| Dev in full control of memory lifestyle|
|Lifetime is controlled by scope mechanism| Life style is controlled explicitly through `new` and `delete` operators|

```c++
// Memory location contains junk value
int* ptr {new int};

// Use direct initialization
int* ptr {new int(2022)};

// Use uniform initialization
int* ptr {new int{2022}};
```

*A pointer that doesn't point to valid memory address. Trying to dereference and use a **dangling pointer** will result in undefined behavior.* Examples of dangling pointers are: 

* Uninitialized pointer
* Deleted pointer
* Multiple pointers pointing to same memory

To avoid dangling pointer:

* Initialize your pointers immediately upon declaration.
* Check for `nullptr` before use.
* Right after a pointer is deleted, remember to assign nullptr to indicate that it points nowhere.

#### If `new` fails
Check for failed memory allocations:

1. Through the exception mechanism
2. The `std::nothrow` setting

### Memory Leak
When we loose access to memory that is dynamically allocated. As a C++ developer, a significant portion of the more serious bugs you deal with often boil down to mismanagement of dynamic memory. It is caused by the followings:
1. Reassigning of stack address to active dynamic address pointer
2. Double allocation
3. Pointer in local scope

## References
A reference is a name that can be used as an alias for another variable. It is the same as pointer to point to something in the memory.

Unlike a pointer, you cannot declare a reference and not initialize it. Also, once a reference is initialized as an alias for some variable, it keeps referring to that same variable for the remainder of its lifetime.

Reference points to a variable while pointer to an address of a variable.

```c++
int& rdata {23};
```

The ampersand following the type name indicates that the variable being defined, `rdata`, is a reference to a variable of type integer. Dereferencing is not necessary in reference.

**Reference Vs Pointer**
|Reference             |Pointer                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
|No need to dereference|Need to be dereferenced  |
|Must be initialized at declaration|Can be declared un-initialized (will contain garbage addresses)|
|Cant be change to reference something else|Can be changed to point somewhere else|

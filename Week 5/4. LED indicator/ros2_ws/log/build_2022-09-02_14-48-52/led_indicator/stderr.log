CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findled_indicator.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "led_indicator", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "led_indicator"
  with any of the following names:

    led_indicatorConfig.cmake
    led_indicator-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "led_indicator" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "led_indicator_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "led_indicator" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

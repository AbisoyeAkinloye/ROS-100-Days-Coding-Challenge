## Virtual Function with default arguments

Default argument values are dealt with at compile time, so you can get unexpected results when you use default argument values with virtual function parameters.

Default argurment in virtual function is bind by the compiler statically. It uses the **default argument in the base function**. As in:

```c++
class Base{
    public:
        Base();
        ~Base();

        virtual double add(double num1=5, double num2=10) const {
            std::cout << "Base::add() called" << std::endl;
            return (num1 + num2 + 1);
        }
}

class Derived : public Base {
    public:
        Derived();
        ~Derived();

        double add(double num1=5, double num2=10) const {
            std::cout << "Base::add() called" << std::endl;
            return (num1 + num2 + 1);
        }
}
```

* Default arguments are handled at compile time.
* Virtual functions are called at run time with polymorphism.
* If you use default arguments with virtual functions, you might get weird result with polymorphism.
* Default arguments with virtual functions can be very confusing. **They are best avoided.**


## Virtual destructors
To ensure that the correct destructor is always called for objects of derived classes that are allocated in the free store, you need virtual class destructors.

Specifying a destructor with `virtual` specifier will allow the compiler to called the destructor as expected. 

To implement a virtual destructor in a derived class, you just add the keyword virtual to the destructor declaration in the base class.

## Dynamic Cast

A dynamic cast is a conversion thatâ€™s performed at runtime. The `dynamic_cast<>()` operator performs a dynamic cast. You can only apply this operator to pointers and references to polymorphic class types, which are class types that contain at least one virtual function.

* Transforming from base class pointer or reference to derived class pointer or reference at run time.
* Makes it possible to call non polymorphic methods on derived objects.

## Polymorphic functions and destructor

**Note:** Never call virtual (polymorphic) function from constructor & destructor.
* Calling a virtual function from a constructor or destructor won't give a polymorphic result or dynamic binding.
* The call will never go to a more derived class than the currently executing constructor or destructor.
* In other words you will get static binding results.
